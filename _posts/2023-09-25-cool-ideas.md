Wow, so finally my website is up and running. It's a static site generator. I wonder how static is it. Can I add games in javascript?  

It is totally okay if the static site cannot be generated at the moment. We tried for I think half an hour by testing different taggs, renaming files, commiting changes but nothing worked. The best we did was rename a working page to reflect changes like a surrogate. So, for now we'll write in this space. 


## grand ideas 

1. an upycling box - store packaging boxes and bottles after cleaning them in this archive, and keep stuff for a week.
    1. make it show up on your todolist app - habitica or ticktick
    2. upcycle stuff at pg
    3. take some time out to checkout upcycling projects
    4. group upcycling project at the park
    5. 
2. between four and six in the morning you have to do something for a 108 times. 
    1. 1088 surya namaskar
    2. 108 times 100 metres - walking, running, cycling 
        1. can go to somya's place for a bath, and come back that night via metro, leave the next day on your bicycle. similarly with kartikey or dhruv's place. 
    3. Pick 108 flowers, no two flowers from the same plant. 
    

running in the morning is tackling two challenges at once - one is waking up early and another is running. 
first, become and early riser, and some habits can help life long. So, give yourself a safety net of fun activities (that are second nature to you now) to do when you're having tough days. 

3. going out with friends 
    1. looking for places that are nostalgic, writing for my blog. go to cafes and tell them you'll capture the aura here for others to find out. check whether its good for reading books, or for coming to play your guitar here. and what not. learn to describe places well and talk to people. 
    2. go to book reseller and find out the bargain. 
    3. go for a swim
    4. a walk in the park
    5. lets cook together today

4. maybe for a while you don't have to think about switching. how about solving problems by changing the least. as in, changing a job will require starting from zero in terms of a living space as well as for office. 

    how about we consider another possiblity where i try to conquer what i have at hand. how about doing well at office before focussing on dsa for a new job. how about achieving comfort so that you can work from home if required. 

    how about working on your living space.. talk to jaideep, maybe an interior ddesiggn perspective. manage the pest problem, get a table chair. make working with beds modular. i can split the beds if you pay me a 100 bucks. helpout in the pg as a volunteer. can you think of it as a gurudwara? yep, so people volunteer. but first someone has to do it. learn to be a property manager. or a to be manager. you can start by documenting improvements. label them, suggest action, estimate expendditure. We have stuff that we can resell, or manage. study tables in open spaces, people can study. take inspiration from the competition we had in iitgn that i served as a judge for.

    hey you can ask atul bhai if we can arrange accomodation for preeti in our building? we can both work on the apartment, hell, we can even google. 

5. physical education teacher with firki. 
    1. yoga movement in parks. bring the youth here. make friends with children (triangular park, delhi slum) and one session could be just repition of surya namaskar.
    2. to befriend chilren, first play football or frisbee or swimming and then plan a yoga session. 
    3. a frisbee movement in delhi, go to slums. 
 

6. learning
    1. teach suraj how to code - get hard copies from home if dad doesn't want them. can hold sessions at home, or in the park. figure.
    2. brilliant.org with yatin, and preparing for olympiads. 
    3. comeptitive programming, getting to some level by the next one year. create plans for each topic - graph, linked-lists, stacks in 20 hour sessions as reccomended by josh. and then cycle. develop breadth. 
    4. internship as an electrician, or electronics repairing. can go to panipat at baljinder bua's place for this. make a deal with your tutor that you'll back with work. so, teach me how to fix my headphone, i will fix ten headphones for you with similar work. maybe you'll have to teach me more, another 10 hours investment before i can be useful but i'll pay back 5x, i'll give you fifty hours of work and i'll manage the shop. 
    5. work at chacha's place for a while working from home.
    6. you have four books, read them, complete their exercises and then sell them as courses. people are looking for teachers online, and this is a hot skill.
    7. workshop to set up a simple website like this one. a small fee, say rs. 50 or rs. 100 a person, maybe as security. so, if you build the website you can have your money back. 
    8. contibute to jekyll or mathjax, find a good first issue. 
        1. build your own note taking app? or add a privacy plugin for some pages to reuire password, or github autenthication to see.
    9. build a slowly extension in vscode. its an all text env that's why i insist. not asking to mix work with personal stuff. this is like an browser, right. so, for another workspace you enable this extension.
